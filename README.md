Title: Expectations from God

What should I expect from God?
or "What do I want from God?"
or "What should I want from God?"
or "What does an ideal relationship with God look like?"

I don't know what an ideal relationship with God looks like. This is my working hypothesis.

I have far more knowledge, wisdom, etc. than my kids do. Also, I am in the position of authority in my relationship with each.

Because I have authority, I get to dictate the terms of my relationship with each of them.
Because I have more wisdom and knowledge, and because I love them, the terms I dictate are better than the terms they would dictate if they had the authority.

As examples:
* they might prefer that I never discipline them. But withholding discipline would stifle their growth.
* They might prefer I play with them late into the night. But if they're not asleep in time, they'll be grumpy and miserable tomorrow.
* They might prefer I let them watch TV and movies all night. But other types of activities will fulfill them more.

I expect it's similar with God.

<a herf="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:9-11&version=ESV">Which of you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?</a> No one. But I might give her something better. As examples:
* If my daughter asks me for a fish, and what she really needed was to learn to catch fish, I might teach her to catch fish rather than give her a fish. In my greater wisdom, I might know it's better for her to learn to catch fish than to be given a fish.
* If my daughter asks me for a pet serpent, I might instead give her a pet fish, which in my greater wisdom, might be better for her.

So, my working hypothesis is:
* God's wisdom and knowledge are infinitely beyond mine
* God loves me
* God knows what's best for me.
* God will therefore give me what's best for me rather than what I want.
* If God and I disagree about what's best for me, God is right and I am wrong.

This side of eternity, can we have the perfect relationship with God that He designed us for? <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+13:10-12&version=ESV">Probably not</a>. But let me ask a different question.
This side of eternity, what is the best possible relationships we can have with God?
Is my current relationship with God already the best it could possibly be, or could it be better?

When I think about "What do I want from God?" or "What do I want my relationship with God to look like?", I try to be open-minded. He knows what's best better than I do. I try to take breadcrumbs from the Bible. 

Right now, I feel spiritually famished. But there are breadcrumbs that indicate I can be spiritually satisfied.
* <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+4:10-15&version=ESV">Jesus offers living water. Whoever drinks it will never be thirsty again. It will become in him a spring af water welling up to eternal life.</a>
* <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6:35&version=ESV">Jesus is the bread of life; whoever comes to him shall never hunger or thirst</a>

But, of course, I'll never have an ideal relationship with God by doing things my way, or having a narrow-minded view of what that relationship should look like. He is infinitely wiser than me. I have to do things God's way. He knows best. There is no way to have the best possible relationship with God without doing things God's way.

So, first question. Is there any command God has given me that I haven't obeyed? If so, I'm not doing things God's way.

Second question: Am I <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+7:7-8&version=ESV">seeking</a> God with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+4:29&version=ESV">all my heart and soul</a>? Do I <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+6:5&version=ESV">love</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+22:37-38&version=NIV">Him</a>?

I don't know exactly what it means to "love God", but it at least means to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+13:44&version=ESV">value God more than anything else</a>. Honestly, I have not been seeking God all that hard lately. I guess that's because I don't value Him accurately.

But here I am, spiritually hungry. Famished, even.

It's time to adjust my values. You seek what you value.
