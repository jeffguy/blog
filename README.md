Title: Expectations from God

What should I expect from God?
or "What do I want from God?"
or "What should I want from God?"
or "What does an ideal relationship with God look like?"

I don't know what an ideal relationship with God looks like. But, I'll share where I'm at. I'll share:
<ol>
<li>An analogy</li>
<li>Some thoughts about the ideal relationship with God</li>
<li>Some thoughts on how I can get there</li>
</ol>

<h4>Analogy</h4>

I have far more knowledge, wisdom, etc. than my kids do. Also, I am in the position of authority in my relationship with each.

Because I have authority, I get to dictate the terms of my relationship with each of them.
Because I have more wisdom and knowledge, and because I love them, the terms I dictate are better than the terms they would dictate if they had the authority.

Examples:
* They might prefer that I never discipline them. But withholding discipline would stifle their growth.
* They might prefer I play with them late into the night. But if they're not asleep in time, they'll be grumpy and miserable tomorrow.
* They might prefer I let them watch TV and movies all night. But other types of activities will fulfill them more.

I expect it's similar with God.

<a herf="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:9-11&version=ESV">Which of you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?</a> No one. But I might give her something better. Examples:
* If my daughter asks for a fish, but she really needs to learn to fish, I might teach her to fish rather than give her a fish.
* If my daughter asks for a pet serpent, I might instead give her a pet fish, which in my greater wisdom, might be better for her.

<h4>What's the ideal relationship with God look like?</h4>

So, my working hypothesis is:
* God's wisdom and knowledge are infinitely beyond mine
* God knows what's best for me.
* God loves me
* God will therefore give me what's best for me rather than what I want.
* If God and I disagree about what's best for me, God is right and I am wrong.

This side of eternity, what is the best possible relationships we can have with God?
Is my current relationship with God already the best it could possibly be, or could it be better?

It's tempting to draw up my own picture of the ideal relationship with God. But if I ask for that, and don't get that, I must remember that God is trustworthy. Sometimes faith means trusting God rather than me trying to be in control. If He doesn't grant my wish, it's because I wished for something that wasn't best for me. Maybe I wished for a serpent and He knows I need a fish. Maybe I wished for a fish and He knows I need to learn to fish.

So I try to be open-minded. He knows better than me. Maybe I can find hints in the Bible.

Right now, I feel spiritually famished. But Jesus hints I can be spiritually satisfied.
* <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+4:10-15&version=ESV">He offers living water. Whoever drinks it will never be thirsty again. It will become in him a spring af water welling up to eternal life.</a>
* <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6:35&version=ESV">Jesus is the bread of life; whoever comes to him shall never hunger or thirst</a>

<h4>How can I get there?</h4>

But, of course, I'll never have an ideal relationship with God by doing things my way, or having a narrow-minded view of what that relationship should look like. He is infinitely wiser than me. I have to do things God's way. He knows best. There is no way to have the best possible relationship with God without doing things God's way.

First, clearly, I'm not the initiator. My whole life, I've pushed Him away more times than I can count. But <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5:6-11&version=ESV">God wanted a relationship</a> with me anyway. He sent Jesus to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5:6-11&version=ESV">live and die so that relationship could be restored</a>. I can never earn God's love. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2&version=ESV">I'm glad He loves me anyway</a>.

So, first question. Is there any command God has given me that I haven't obeyed? If so, I'm not doing things God's way.

Second question: Am I <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+7:7-8&version=ESV">seeking</a> God with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+4:29&version=ESV">all my heart and soul</a>? <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut+6:5&version=ESV">Do I</a> love <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+22:37-38&version=NIV">Him</a>?

I don't know exactly what it means to "love God", but it at least means to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+13:44&version=ESV">value God more than anything else</a>. Honestly, I have not been seeking God all that hard lately. I guess that's because I don't value Him accurately.

But here I am, spiritually hungry. Famished, even.

It's time to adjust my values. You seek what you value.

Time to start that journey.
