I guess I should start with, "Am I interested in getting to know God?". He is the highest being. Given that shockingly He is interested in spending time with me, it would seem strange to pass that up.

But maybe there are reasons to pass it up. What if His interests don't align with mine? It's easier to have relationship with people who share my interests. He's probably not interested in the same things I am.

On second thought, do I really know what He's interested in? Perhaps that would be worth learning.

It could even turn out that His interests are more interesting than my interests. Who's to say my interests are the best? Maybe His interests would be more interesting to me than my own. Perhaps that's a good starting point for a relationship with God: finding out what His interests are.

... several minutes pass ...

I noticed myself engaging my mind, starting to think about what I know of God and what His interests are. But the point was to begin a relationship with Him. Shouldn't I ask Him what His interests are? Shouldn't I use this as an opportunity to engage in a relationship?

... several minutes pass ...

Then, even given that starting point, I realize I'm not even sure how to do that. So I engaged my mind again: I could search the Bible for the answers. I could read a Tim Keller book on prayer. Pause. Instead of engaging my mind, maybe I should take this, too, before God, and talk to Him about His to relate to Him.
